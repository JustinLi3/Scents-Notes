            <p>Buying a fragrance can be a great experience, but it’s important to do it the right way to avoid fake or expired products. Here’s my personal method for buying fragrances online:</p>
            
            <h2 class="mt-4">1. Choose Your Platform</h2>
            <p>I recommend using platforms like <a href="https://www.ebay.com" target="_blank">eBay</a> or <a href="https://www.mercari.com" target="_blank">Mercari</a>. These platforms often have great deals, but you need to be cautious.</p>
            
            <h2 class="mt-4">2. Check the Batch Number</h2>
            <p>Before making a purchase, always check or ask the seller for the batch number. This number is usually printed on the box or the bottom of the bottle. Once you have it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="p-2">Go to <a href="https://checkcosmetic.net" target="_blank">CheckCosmetic.net</a></li>
                <li class="p-2">Enter the batch number to verify the manufacturing date and ensure the product isn’t expired.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2 class="mt-4">3. Inspect the Pictures</h2>
            <p>Carefully review the pictures provided by the seller. Look for:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="p-2">Clear, high-quality images of the bottle and box.</li>
                <li class="p-2">Details such as the font, logo, and packaging that match the original product.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2 class="mt-4">4. Check Reviews</h2>
            <p>Always check the seller’s reviews and ratings:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="p-2">Look for sellers with high ratings and positive feedback.</li>
                <li class="p-2">Read through recent reviews to ensure their products are authentic.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2 class="mt-4">5. Trust Your Instincts</h2>
            <p>If something feels off—whether it’s the price, the photos, or the seller’s communication—trust your instincts and move on to another listing.</p>
            
            <h2 class="mt-4">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Following these steps can help you get great deals on cologne while avoiding fakes and expired products. Happy shopping!</p>
